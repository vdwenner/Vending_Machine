Welcome to Vending Machine OS!
This is an Operating System for a vending machine, which tracks inventory, counts money deposited, dispenses selected item, then calculates and returns correct change to the user
in the form of coins.

Official Description: "You've been asked to develop an application for the newest vending machine distributor, Umbrella Corp. They've released a new vending machine, Vendo-Matic
800, that is integrated with everyone's bank accounts, allowing customers to purchase products from their computers for their convenience."

As our first capstone project, we were provided a Menu Class which we were not allowed to modify.

As a bonus, we were asked to make a "secret" menu option which would allow staff to see a list of all transactions since the machine was activated. To accomplish this, we provided
an overload constructor which adds an additional option which isn't displayed with the list of standard options.

As of our peer review, my team was the only team that was able to figure out and implement the bonus question.
